/* containers in C++

STL =  containers++++++++++++++ algorithm +++++++++++++++ ilerators(object which points to an element of a container)
       (store data)      (procedure to process data)


Container 
 1. Sequence containers ------->   store datta in linear fashion eg->> 7->9->0->4->6 ex vector, list, deque
 2. Associative contaniers----->   Direct access  eg set/ multiset , map/multimap 
 3. Derived containers -------->   real world modeling eg-> stack queue priority-queue   
 
 (stack method)LIFO - LAST IN FIRST OUT 
 queue (FIFO) - FIRST IN FIRST OUT


 WHEN TO USE WHICH??
 a. Sequence containers
         1. Vector -> Random access is fast & middle insertition / deletion is slow  but insertionation at the end is faster 
         2. List   -> Random access is slow middle insertion  is fast && insertion/del. at the end is faster
 b. Associative conationers --> all operations are fast except random access
 c. Derived container --> Depends
