/* OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING

WHY OOPS??(drawback of c)
---> c upgraded to c++ by adding object oriented feature(old name of c++ is c with classes)
---> as size of program is increase its readiablity, maintainablity and bug free nature of program decreases.
---> as data almost neglected , data security was easily compromised.
---> using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.

POP (PROCEDURE ORIENTED PROGRAMING )(abhi tk bat ki thi)
-----> consist of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow
-----> main focus is on functions and not on flow of data
-----> function can either use local or global data
-----> data moves openly from function to function

OOP(OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING)
work on concept of classes and objects
a class is template to create objects
treats data as a critical element 
decomposes the problem in object and builds data and functions around the objects
                
                TERMINOLOGY

CLASSES: 
           It is a building block, use for basic template for creating objects
           user define data type which holds its own data members & its member functions ;
           class is like blue brint of object 
           when class is define no memory is allcated but when object is created then memory is allocated

eg- The class of cars there may be many cars of different type and differrent specification but together known as car

Objects:- basic run time entities. 

Data abstraction & encapsulation:- Wraping data and functions into single unit  main function of abstraction of data is to show use ful information and hide useless data

Inheritance:- similarity (eg- ypur nose is same as your father{gunnn transfer}) [property transfer of] one classes can be inherited into other

polymorphism:- ability to take more than one forms(shaktiman and gangadhar is same)

dynamic/late binding:- code which will execute is not known until the program run. code will be known when we run it.{ex gm ga gn time is set }

Message passing:- object.message(information) call format.


        BENEFITS OF OOP
Better code reusablity using objects and inheritance.
principle of data hiding helps built secure system.
Multiple objects objects can co-exist without any interference of data.
Software complexity can be easily managed.
