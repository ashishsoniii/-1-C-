STL : standard template library ----->compititive programming ---> limited time
       it helps in reusing codes
       It is library of GENERIC CLASSES AND FUNCTION

why use STL?
   We use well tested components  
   time saving!!

components of STL
  -containers --> stores dat, use template classes 
  -algorithms --> sorting , searching, use template functions
  -ilerators  --> object points to an element in a container , 
                  handles just like pointers , 
                  connects algorithm with container

STL is used because its a good idea not to reinvent the wheel
