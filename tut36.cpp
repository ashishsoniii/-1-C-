       Inheritance in cpp {OOPS}

## overview
reusability is very important feature of OOPs
In c++ we can reuse a class and add additional feature to it
Reusing classes saves time and money
reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot  of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again

## What is Inheritance in C++?
The concept of reusability in c++ is supporting using inheritance 
We can reuse the properties of an existing class bt inherititing from it
the existing class is caled as the BASE CLASS
The new class which is inherited is called as the DERIVED CLASS 
Reusing classes saves time and money
There are different types of inheritance in C++

## FORMS OF INHERITANCE IN C++
SINGLE INHERITANCE 
MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE
MULTILEEVEL INHERITANCE
HYBRID INHERITANCE

SINGLE INHERITANCE 
             A Derived class with only one base class 
eg----->        A------derived------>B     iif  A<------is derived from-----B  both same 

MULTIPLE INHERITANCE 
             A Derived class with more than one Base class    A(employee)   ++  B(assistance) -------> C (programmer)


HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE
            Several derived class from a single base class (opposite of multiple)        c ----------->  A  ++ B


MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE 
            Derived a class from already derived class                   A (animal)------->  B(mammal) --------> C(dog)


HYBRID INHERITANCE 
 It is combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance 
 a class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance
 However one of the parent classes is not a base class.      A-----> B ++ C ------> D
